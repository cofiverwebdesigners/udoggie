<h1>Technical Expertise.</h1>

non technical skills that i have managed to grasp as a programmer. 
some of the skills have been placed in category current. These

<h2>Acadermic writing</h2>
<p class="myp">During my third year,  in my statistics ad programming journey, a friend of mine 
introduced me to Acadermic wrtiting around may,2021.
He told me about different styles of writing and 
formatting  acadermic papers.He also told me different types of Acadermic papers that 
i would likely emcounter when writing (research papers, essay, discussion posts e.t.c). 
since then and until today, i have interacted with differet Acadermic papers and 
this skill has been successfully embedded in my skull.</p>

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<p class="myp">I am a data Analyst with a strong command in R and Python Programming Languages.
Dr Euna, who introduced me to R Programming encouraged us  during one of her 
lectures that it is possible to teach oneself a skill and earn good from it. 
This motivated me  a lot and from  then 
i started learning Data Analysis through coursera and today i can proudly say that 
i can analyse spartial data, survey data and sentimental data including 
other forms of Data. </p>

<h2>Research Projects </h2>
<p class="myp">
I write Research proposals for students taking their masters and doctoral programmes.
I learnt this art late August 2023 and before that year ended, i wrote research 
proposals for more than 10 students and their lecturers gave  them authorization 
to continue with chapters 4 and 5 which  i also did it for them. I collected the data 
and analysed it using R and Excel and communicated the insights in chapter 5.
